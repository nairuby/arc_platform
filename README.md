## Step 1: Install Prerequisites

### Installing ASDF


[ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) is a tool capable of managing all runtimes locally. Follow the instructions for installation, especially for Windows WSL users.

Install dependencies for compiling Ruby:

* macOS: Install Homebrew

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

* Ubuntu/ Windows WSL

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev
```

2. Installing ASDF version manager

```sh
cd
git clone https://github.com/excid3/asdf.git ~/.asdf
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'legacy_version_file = yes' >> ~/.asdfrc
exec $SHELL
```

#### Installing Ruby via ASDF
Install ASDF plugins.

```sh
asdf plugin add ruby
asdf plugin add nodejs
```

Install Ruby and set the default version by running the following commands:

```sh
asdf install ruby 3.4.1

# Set the default Ruby version
asdf global ruby 3.4.1

# Update to the latest Rubygems version
gem update --system
```

Install foreman gem

```shell
gem install foreman
```

Confirm the default Ruby version matches the version you just installed.

```sh
which ruby
#=> /Users/username/.asdf/shims/ruby
ruby -v
#=> 3.4.1
```

Install Node.js for handling Javascript in our Rails app

```sh
asdf install nodejs 20.9.0
asdf global nodejs 20.9.0

which node
#=> /Users/username/.asdf/shims/node
node -v
#=> 20.9.0

# Install yarn for Rails jsbundling/cssbundling or webpacker
npm install -g yarn
```

To switch to a different Ruby and Node version for a specific project, you can use the following command to set the Ruby or Node version for that project. You should be in the project directory.

```sh
asdf local ruby <ruby version>  # eg 3.4.1
asdf local nodejs <nodejs version> # eg 20.9.0
```

### Step 2: Create a Fork & Branch

1. Create a fork of this repository from the main branch.
2. Select an issue to work on from the main repository.
3. Create a branch named after the selected issue from the main branch.

*Note: Keep your fork in sync with the main repository, and make all changes on this branch.*

### Step 3: Clone & Install Dependencies

```sh
$ git clone <link to your forked repo>
$ cd <path to your cloned repo>
$ bundle install
```

### Step 4: Setup the Database

```sh
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
```

### Step 4: Install Yarn Dependencies

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Step 5: Start Server

```sh
$ ./bin/dev
```

### Step 6: Creating a Pull Request

1. Make changes locally on your branch.
2. Push your changes to your branch on GitHub.
3. Create a pull request to the main branch of the main repository.

### Step 7: Merging

Once your changes are reviewed, they will be merged into the main branch.
